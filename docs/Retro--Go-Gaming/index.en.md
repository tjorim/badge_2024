# Retro-Go Gaming

Retro-Go is a program to play old (but good!) games on ESP32-based devices, such as the Fri3d Camp 2024 Badge.
The project consists of a "launcher" and a selection of the best applications and emulators, seriously optimized to require less CPU, memory and storage, without being less compatible!

## Controls

### Launcher buttons

## SD Card or internal storage

The badge will try to use the micro SD card (formatted as FAT32) and if that fails, the internal storage.

When you insert a new micro SD card, it is recommended to first fill it with the latest `default_files_config_and_games.zip` from [the releases page](https://github.com/Fri3dCamp/badge_retro-go/releases) so that you have all the correct default settings, such as wifi networks.

## Find games

If you would like to search for games that you do not have on a friend's badge, you can do so directly, without the need for a laptop or SD card reader!

It works in 3 steps:

1) **your friend turns on his hotspot** *(X button -> "Wi-Fi options" -> "Wi-Fi Access Point" and choose one, for example "retro-go-channel-3")*

2) **you connect to his hotspot** *(X button -> "Wi-Fi options" -> "Wi-Fi select" -> "retro-go-channel-3" your friend chose)*

![8](find-games/IMG_20240815_085955786.jpg)

3) **you are looking for games** *(Y button -> "Find games" -> choose a map)*

![10](find-games/IMG_20240815_090021780.jpg)
![11](find-games/IMG_20240815_090101521_HDR.jpg)

This might take a while, but if you get tired of it you can always stop it by restarting your badge.

If you get an error, try again - it will skip games you already have.

*Tip: Put the best few games in a folder `/roms/nes/best`, `/roms/gb/best` or `/roms/gbc/best` and put your own games in `/roms/gbc/gbstu` so you can easily find them.*

## Make your own games

With [GBStudio](https://www.gbstudio.dev/) you can easily make different types of games for GameBoy Color. If you search for 'GBStudio' on YouTube you will find a [really good playlist of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNXlV2tt7eE&list=PLmac3HPrav--Q4QKUVknwwMSNk1YECFKT) that will quickly teach you everything you need to know.

## About Retro-Go

Retro-go itself has [support for the Fri3d Camp 2024 Badge](https://github.com/ducalex/retro-go/tree/dev/components/retro-go/targets/fri3d-2024) but the derivative version [badge_retro-go](https://github.com/Fri3dCamp/badge_retro-go) contains a lot more bells and whistles that are *too specific* for Fri3d Camp to be included in the general version.

### Supported systems:

- Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
- Gameboy
- Gameboy Color
- DOOM (also mods!)

There are other systems supported but they are not activated on the Fri3D Camp 2024 Badge because they are less popular or because they were a bit too slow.

### Features:

- Favorites and recently played games
- GameBoy color palettes, adjust and save clock
- NES color palettes, PAL ROMs, NSF support
- Options to scale and filter the screen
- Good performance and compatibility
